# Qt-Middleware-Window
A Qt WebEngineWidgets window that loads an internet or a local file on disk

QWebEngineWigets

A simple project designed to display a website or load pages in a Qt window. Where the application is Ajax or node.js and the Window is Qt.

Middleware runs in a browser, and so it avoids the compatibility issues plaguing almost all programming languages. Technologies such as jQuery, Ajax, node.js are used to develop applications that run in the Qt container, locally as well as on the Internet.

Example application, say a business wants to load a video on a big TV in their shop window. They create a simple webpage script that displays the video on repeat, store it on their hard disk and play it in the container. The programmability ensures a dominant full screen, rather than it popping out overnight and displaying the desktop instead.

The code runs a site in a window with all controls disabled. Place the html pages in hte build directory

All functions have been disabled, F toggles fullscreen and send the cursor to bottom right out of view.

The new code using QWebEngineWigets, while the inlcuded old code uses QWebKitWidgets.
